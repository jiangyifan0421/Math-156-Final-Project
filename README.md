Project Focus
We aim to develop machine learning models for accurately classifying sizable news corpora from the BBC full-text document classification dataset into five categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. The content on these topics covers rather unique linguistic characteristics and peculiarities related to a peculiar context. Being the first assignment, the main objective is to compare how the highest level of efficiency of different techniques of NLP and various methods treat the problem of accurate categorization of news content.
